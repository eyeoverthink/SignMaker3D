1. The Engineering Logic (What was missing)To create a high-quality 3D signage tool, the system must calculate four specific geometric variables:The Tolerance Gap (Kerf): If an LED strip is 6mm, a 6mm hole is too tight. The code must allow for a "Tolerance Offset" (usually +0.2mm to +0.4mm) so the light fits without breaking the plastic.The Miter Limit: When offsetting sharp corners (like the tip of a 'V'), the geometry often "explodes" into a long spike. The system needs a logic to clip or round corners automatically.The "Internal Bridge" (Supportless Printing): To avoid "support material" (which is a pain to clean out of channels), the top of the internal wire channels should be shaped like a Teardrop or a 45-degree Chamfer so the printer can bridge the gap naturally.Island Logic: For letters like 'O', 'A', or 'B', the "middle" part (the island) must be physically connected to the outer shell via a "bridge" or the backplate, otherwise, it falls out during printing.2. The "Ultra-Prompt" for the Building AICopy and paste this into your coding-focused AI. This is designed to trigger "Senior Engineer" mode."Act as a Senior Computational Geometry Engineer. We are building a Parametric 3D Neon Signage Generator.Core Objective: Create a script (React + Three.js + CSG) that transforms 2D font paths into 3D printable 'Channel Letters.'Technical Specifications for Geometry Generation:Path Insetting: Implement a 'Polygon Offsetting' algorithm (like Clipper.js) to create the channel walls. User must define 'Wall Thickness' and 'Channel Width.'3D Print Optimization: >    - Ensure all extruded meshes are Manifold (Watertight).Add a 'Tolerance Variable' (float) to the Channel Width to account for plastic shrinkage.Implement Chamfered Ceilings inside internal wire tunnels to allow for support-free 3D printing.Smart Features:Wire Pathing: Automatically calculate the 'Centroid' of each character and place a cylinder-subtraction (hole) for wire exit.Mounting Lugs: Generate 'Keyhole' mounting tabs that are boolean-unioned to the back of the letter.Auto-Splitter: If the bounding box of the letter exceeds $X,Y$ dimensions, implement a 'Dovetail Joint' cut to split the model for smaller print beds.UI/UX Requirements:Real-time 3D preview using a MeshStandardMaterial to simulate plastic.Export functionality specifically for Binary STL format.Task: Provide the architectural pseudocode and the specific Three.js logic for the 'ExtrudeGeometry' and 'CSG Boolean' operations that create the light channel."3. How to Evaluate the ResultWhen the other AI gives you the code, look for these three "Success Markers":CSG Operations: Does it mention "Subtracting" or "Difference"? (This is how it makes the holes).Clipper.js or Offset Logic: Does it address how it creates the "inner wall"? (If it just scales the letter down, the wall thickness will be uneven; it must use an offset/inset algorithm).BufferGeometry: Does it use BufferGeometry for the export? (This ensures the file isn't too heavy for your 3D printer's slicer).
